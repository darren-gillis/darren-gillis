- 👋 Hi, I’m @darren-gillis
- 👀 I’m interested in fisheries analysis, fleet dynamics, animal behaviour
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more every day to study "fishing effort"
  - Spatio-temporal GLMMs and GAMMs
  - Bayesian methods
    - using JAGS and possibly STAN and GRETA
  - forager (fish or vessel) movement
    - theoretical: ideal free distributions, random walks
    - empirical: acoustic telemetry, mark-recapture 
  - performance in vessel networks
    - metrics (density, centrality, etc.)
    - exponential random graph models (exogenous vs endogenous factors)
    - social network theory (e.g. "strength of weak ties")
  - empirical dynamic modelling
  - structural equation modeling
  - ... (as required)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on 
  - theoretical and empirical questions regarding fleet dynamics
  - tests of behavioural hypotheses using fisheries data
- 📫 How to reach me Darren.Gillis@umanitoba.ca
