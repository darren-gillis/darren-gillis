- 👋 Hi, I’m @darren-gillis
- 👀 I’m interested in fisheries analysis, animal behaviour, fleet dynamics
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more every day study "fishing effort"
  - Bayesian methods
  - spatio-temporal analysis
  - movement analysis (hydroacoustic, mark-recapture)
  - network theory and analysis
  - empirical dynamic modelling
  - ... (as required)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on 
  - questions regarding fleet dynamics
  - tests of behavioural hypotheses using fish harvester data
- 📫 How to reach me Darren.Gillis@umanitoba.ca
